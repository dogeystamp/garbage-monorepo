# hanzi-flash

Generate flashcards for a range of frequent hanzi characters.

There are multiple sources for words:

- [hanziDB CSV](https://github.com/ruddfawcett/hanziDB.csv) (purely frequency based)
- [hsk CSV](https://github.com/plaktos/hsk_csv) (common usage words, graded by difficulty)

Be careful to keep the filenames as `hanzi_db.csv` and `hsk*.csv` because the script tries to recognize these.
